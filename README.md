# cox Scala Stock Watcher

A Scala/Play2 backend that exposes a web-service & websocket API for stock searching, and adding & removing stocks to/from a real-time stock price watcher

## Prerequisites & Assumptions

- You are working on windows
- Install npm or yarn

- You have scala installed (`npm install sbt`)
	- `sbt sbtVersion` ==> `1.3.8`

### Steps to boot it up

1. Clone this repo locally
	- `git clone https://github.com/ajball/cox-coding-exercise.git`
2. Navigate to the project root dir
	-  `cd cox-scala-exercise`
3. Start the app
	- `sbt run`
	- Alternatively, you can open the project in Intellij and create a Scala Play2 run configuration to boot up the server. Found this to be more reliable at times, especially when I ran into problems related to stale or missing dependencies
4. Open Postman or Google Chrome and request `http://localhost:9000`. Might take several seconds for the class files to compile and whatnot, but if the app started successfully, you should you should see the following json response:

```
{
  "search_stocks_url": "GET /stocks?search=${searchTerm}",
  "init_stock_watcher_url": "GET /watch",
  "add_stock_to_watcher_url": "POST /stocks Body: { symbol: ${symbol} }",
  "remove_stock_from_watcher_url": "DELETE /stocks/${symbol}"
}

API for average is pending as mix and max price is missing with yahoo finance api. If moving average is expected for longer period it requires more changes and more time.

```

### Front-End dependencies

There's a javascript client that was built to consume the stock watcher backend. That will be separate repo.
